# Lovely-browser - normal theme
Umm i haven't work on cute themes and DOOM one yet so pls wait Gomenn nasai!

# Requirements
Please do this command with python installed and use the py cmd *`pip install PyQt5`*

# Important
**ANY WEBSITES THAT ARE USING MGP VIDEO PLAYER WONT WORK FOR THIS.**

**Make sure to have a .venv contains Scripts and inside it contains activate file so that it will work.**


So sad that it is not working for MGP video type and also it is sometimes broken with text fonts so yeah sadly web engine is limited for a radius.

# To run it
**To run it just simply extract (basically yes) and then run***`'mainBoot.bat'`* **. Yeah just it and wait about 1s it will pops up, there is a few bugs going on around but im bored to fix it and instead i used AIs so sorry about that :).**
**Make sure to have a .venv contains Scripts and inside it contains activate file so that it will work.**

**a few words**
*uh btw ignore the cmd window when running mainBoot.bat because it just debug version so there is output goin' on there ;)*
